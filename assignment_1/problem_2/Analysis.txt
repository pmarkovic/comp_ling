Analysis:
------------

Unigram model:
    - As expected, there are no syntactical structure nor meaning in the sentences.
    - Only some phrases can be detected, like This trade profit. But they are lucky coincidance, as model is totaly random.

Bigram model:
    - Syntactically, there are phrases that are fine, like efforts to retaliate with Bankers Fidelity.
    - Punctions are bad placed.
    - Still no meaning in sentences.
    - Titles are well generated, even longer ones like JORDAN BRANCH FOR CASH DISTRIBUTION MONTHLY PAYOUT. Titles are novel, there are no such in corpus, so kind of creative.
    - It can be said that style exists (first title, than text).

Trigram model:
    - With this model, some syntactically correct sentences emarge.
    - Sentences are also somewhat meaningful.
    - Better quality then unigram model, but still not much. 
    - Title with subtitle are fairly ok, but then rest of the text loses course.

Quatrigram model:
    - Syntax is much better here, correct sentences can be identified in the whole text.
    - There is no much meaning in texts as whole, but some sentences do provide some meaningful information.
    - Problem with generating titles (no title, or almost only uppercase words), not good style overall.
    - Some longer phrases tend to be similar to the original text, but there is degree of creativity. With bigger n, creativity decline a little.
